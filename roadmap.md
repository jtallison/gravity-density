# Gravity|Density

What needs to be done, should be done, could be done.

### TODO: Audio Mostly
- [ ] Test [VDO.Ninja](https://vdo.ninja/)
- [ ] Test devices sampling
- [ ] move to render
- [ ] 


### To Move to NexusHub

- [ ] Map position select (add image replacement) 
- [ ] hub.js storing of users able to be recalled upon restart (storage outside of container based on restart)
- [ ] module to upload audio file (w/ possible compression)
- [ ] module to read all files in a folder (hub.files?)
- [ ] module to load and play audio files on command
- [ ] module for control of defined synth/processor and insertion into the webAudio chain.
- [ ] 

## TO REPAIR:

- [ ] Verification of loading audio file (client respond back to server)
- [ ] Audio reset if stuck and not getting audio file (client side)
- [ ] Update the docker container to use recent node (12?)

- [x] Must setup https cert to be able to use getUserMedia when served not locally
- [x] Audio files can be saved easily as .ogg and used on laptops and Android, but not on iOS devices. They can be saved as .wav and used on all 3, but it has a large file size -- also, right now the .wav file headers are not formatted properly and still won't load on iOS devices... simply opening them in an audio app and re-saving them allows them to be loaded -- Ergo, either fix the wav file corruption, or set up a service on the server that takes the blobs and compresses them using ffmpg to create mp3 files.
One of these will work: https://www.gettoby.com/p/nsw633902rsm

## TODO:

- [ ] Mox: Fix the intro overlay screen to pop stars and make space sounds
- [ ] Mox: Add the overlay to the end with fading out of sound
- [ ] Mox: Update words for each section/control make sure it makes sense.
- [ ] Mox: Record the words for instructional playback on the phones
- [ ] Mox: Create module for any set of files for transfer randomly, individual random, collective loading

- [x] Deploy - tried now, but they've disabled docker and node.js deployment (shoot) moving to Heroku
- [ ] battle test wavesurfer usage. Make loop points fully functional  https://www.gettoby.com/p/sf4gx56916kf
- [ ] Create UI for me as an ensemble sample performer (see list below)
- [ ] Implement audience - mute, reset/clear, instruction layer, sample playback w/ illumination, receiving and loading samples.
- [ ] Add event emitter to: all the things   https://www.gettoby.com/p/dtklyqd75qs1 add node eventemitter package  https://medium.com/technoetics/node-js-event-emitter-explained-d4f7fd141a1a  https://www.npmjs.com/package/events  


### Audience UI

- [ ] Loop when held (for some reason onmousedown & onmouseup are not functioning)
- [ ] 

- [x] find font/text style that is NASA friendly
- [x] Orbital Logo to interact with (via gravitdesigner)

### Hub UI

- [ ] Empty uploads folder (of .mp3, .wav. or both)
- [ ] Clear Audio at once
- [ ] Clear Audio by individual over time
- [ ] Trigger Launch (all at once)
- [ ] Enable Sampling all at once
- [ ] Enable Sampling individually over time
- [ ] Create map of locations - use #seatMap svg to insert audience members and click to select with in certain radius
- [ ] ..

## Bendit Board Stuff

- [ ] Make ribbon cable for pedal pot wiring
- [ ] Build thrid board to control pedal stomp switch
- [ ] Make ribbon cable for pedal stop switch wiring
- [ ] Add third board controls into performance interface

## Sound Gathering

- delay pedal
- satellite sounds pings, etc.
- LIGO  sounds - measuring gravity
- Spudnik pings 

## CHECK:

- ch1 board 2 not fully swinging 0-100kOhms

## BendIt.io integration

- Analyze code for BendIt make folding path
- shift core functionality to it's own nexusHub instance
- Update UI for full BendIt.io board functionality
- buildout communication between nexusHubs
