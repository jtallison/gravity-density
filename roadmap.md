# Gravity|Density

What needs to be done, should be done, could be done.

## Notes
- Have an object or at least a .js file with all of the control methods, settings, dom interactions, graphics drawing, etc. 
- likely that audio is all in it's own .js
- have another file that just receives and sends communications and executes the other code.  e.g. your command script for the composition.
- In this way, if anything is misbehaving it is due to the control methods, not the script. the script is there just to trigger the appropriate actions at the appropriate time.


### TODO: Audio Mostly
- [ ] Upgrade render to a beefier server
- [ ] Get beepy star screen functioning
- [ ] set timer - if no sample is returned within 10 seconds, automatically load another sample.
- [ ] delay return of playing a file after sampling until the new sound has loaded.
- [ ] get recording of India - Modhi
- [ ] Mission Control - Check the Messages
- [x] Check and fix iOS interactions
- [x] load beep.mp3, JunoMorse.mp3 and noisy-beep-delay.mp3 for star intro, first sound of the piece, 
- [x] Automatically start with a beep when loading the page
- [x] Mission Control - graphically represent the dots
- [x] Mission Control – when playback is triggered make automation
- [x] Test [VDO.Ninja](https://vdo.ninja/)
- [x] Setup Routing with Blackhole and Audio Interface...
- [x] Test devices sampling
- [x] move to render

### Someday
- [ ] refactor gravSound.js
- [ ] refactor gravSoundHub.js
- [ ] refactor index.js and create score.js (or commandScript.js or cueScript.js or ...)


### To Move to NexusHub

- [ ] Map position select (add image replacement) 
- [ ] hub.js storing of users able to be recalled upon restart (storage outside of container based on restart)
- [ ] module to upload audio file (w/ possible compression)
- [ ] module to read all files in a folder (hub.files?)
- [ ] module to load and play audio files on command
- [ ] module for control of defined synth/processor and insertion into the webAudio chain.
- [ ] 

## TO REPAIR:

- [ ] Verification of loading audio file (client respond back to server)
- [ ] Audio reset if stuck and not getting audio file (client side)
- [ ] Update the docker container to use recent node (12?)

- [x] Must setup https cert to be able to use getUserMedia when served not locally
- [x] Audio files can be saved easily as .ogg and used on laptops and Android, but not on iOS devices. They can be saved as .wav and used on all 3, but it has a large file size -- also, right now the .wav file headers are not formatted properly and still won't load on iOS devices... simply opening them in an audio app and re-saving them allows them to be loaded -- Ergo, either fix the wav file corruption, or set up a service on the server that takes the blobs and compresses them using ffmpg to create mp3 files.
One of these will work: https://www.gettoby.com/p/nsw633902rsm

## TODO:

- [ ] Mox: Fix the intro overlay screen to pop stars and make space sounds
- [ ] Mox: Add the overlay to the end with fading out of sound
- [ ] Mox: Update words for each section/control make sure it makes sense.
- [ ] Mox: Record the words for instructional playback on the phones
- [ ] Mox: Create module for any set of files for transfer randomly, individual random, collective loading

- [x] Deploy - tried now, but they've disabled docker and node.js deployment (shoot) moving to Heroku
- [ ] battle test wavesurfer usage. Make loop points fully functional  https://www.gettoby.com/p/sf4gx56916kf
- [ ] Create UI for me as an ensemble sample performer (see list below)
- [ ] Implement audience - mute, reset/clear, instruction layer, sample playback w/ illumination, receiving and loading samples.
- [ ] Add event emitter to: all the things   https://www.gettoby.com/p/dtklyqd75qs1 add node eventemitter package  https://medium.com/technoetics/node-js-event-emitter-explained-d4f7fd141a1a  https://www.npmjs.com/package/events  


### Audience UI

- [ ] Loop when held (for some reason onmousedown & onmouseup are not functioning)
- [ ] 

- [x] find font/text style that is NASA friendly
- [x] Orbital Logo to interact with (via gravitdesigner)

### Hub UI

- [ ] Get list of all audio recordings on server
- [ ] Empty uploads folder (of .mp3, .wav. or both)
- [ ] Clear Audio at once
- [ ] Clear Audio by individual over time
- [ ] Trigger Launch (all at once)
- [ ] Enable Sampling all at once
- [ ] Enable Sampling individually over time
- [ ] Create map of locations - use #seatMap svg to insert audience members and click to select with in certain radius
- [ ] ..

- [ ] Make ribbon cable for pedal stop switch wiring
- [ ] Add third board controls into performance interface

## Sound Gathering

- delay pedal
- satellite sounds pings, etc.
- LIGO  sounds - measuring gravity
- Spudnik pings 

## CHECK:

- ch1 board 2 not fully swinging 0-100kOhms

## BendIt.io integration
